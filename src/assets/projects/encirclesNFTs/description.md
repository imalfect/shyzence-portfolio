Encircles NFTs feature real paintings by the artist, each measuring a mere 1" in diameter and hand painted on paper. They are gently limited to a series of 5 NFTs per painting, and priced modestly to encourage collecting.

The collection is minted on Polygon and can be found [here.](https://opensea.io/collection/encircles)
